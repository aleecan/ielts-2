* Standard compliant React Native App Utilizing [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite)

## What's the purpose
I developed it to help practise Chinese-English translation.

The way to practise is very easy, every row of translation list consists of three lines, the first line is chinese, the second line is english, and the last line is a remark of the english.

When you add a row, the first line and the last line (the remark) are visibe, try to translate it. If you want to see the correct translation, just press the row.
